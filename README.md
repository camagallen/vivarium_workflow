# vivarium_workflow
This repo houses supplementary documentation for IHME's Vivarium modeling framework and Vivarium Public Health extension.   

# Important Note
Some documentation files have not yet been converted from their executable files. Thus their links will lead to a 404 Not Found error, HOWEVER they are functional and downloadable. We hope to have this issue corrected shortly.

## Documentation Principles
Accessible project documentation can be used to improve any modeling workflow by following these principles:

### 1) Remember the Audience
    Your audience is a busy person using your documentation to move-on with other work. Make it accessible to that person.

### 2) Illustrate
    

### 3) Iterate & Collaborate


### 4) Use Templated Outputs as a Form of Documentation
