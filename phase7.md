# Process Revision
The Process Revision Phase is intended for reflection upon the model development process with the goal of iterative, incremental improvement. Discussions should focus on improvement of the modeling workflow rather than on one specific model. For example, communication (including documentation, scheduling, form creation, etcetera), tool building, and &quot;fat trimming&quot; are all excellent discussion topics.
