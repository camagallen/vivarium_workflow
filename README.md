## Documentation Principles
Accessible project documentation can be used to improve any modeling workflow by following these principles:

### 1) Remember the Audience
    Your audience is a busy person using your documentation to move-on with other work. Make it accessible to that person.

### 2) Illustrate
    

### 3) Iterate & Collaborate


### 4) Use Templated Outputs as a Form of Documentation
